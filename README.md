## 💻 Want to Run Locally? (Optional for Devs)

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/girlfriend-grievance-portal.git
   cd girlfriend-grievance-portal
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   .\venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   Edit the `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following:

    ```env
    # Gmail address to send notifications from (admin)
    EMAIL_ADMIN=admin.email@example.com

    # App-specific password generated from your Gmail account
    EMAIL_PASS=yourapppassword

    # The default sender for outgoing emails (usually same as EMAIL_ADMIN)
    EMAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=admin.email@example.com

    # Recipient email address for user (the person submitting grievances)
    EMAIL_USER_RECEIVER=user.email@example.com

    # Username and password for user (grievance submitter)
    USER_NAME=girlfriend
    USER_PASSWORD=user123

    # Username and password for admin (responder)
    ADMIN_NAME=boyfriend
    ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123

    # Your hosted app URL (used in email templates)
    PORTAL_URL=http://your-grievance-portal-url
    ```
   - Replace `admin.email@example.com` and `user.email@example.com` with your actual Gmail credentials.
   - Replace `girlfriend` and `boyfriend` with user and admin display names respectively, as desired. Similarly with their corresponding passwords.
   - The `EMAIL_PASS` should be your Gmail app password (not your Google account password).

    To generate a Gmail app password:  
    - Visit [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
    - Generate a 16-character password and paste it as `EMAIL_PASS`

5. **Initialize the database:**

   ```bash
   python
   >>> from app import init_db
   >>> init_db()
   ```

   This will create the necessary SQLite database for storing grievances.

6. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   The portal should now be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

1. **Login:**
   - Regular users can log in with the `USER_NAME` and `USER_PASSWORD`.
   - Administrators can log in with the `ADMIN_NAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
